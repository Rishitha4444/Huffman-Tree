## Description

This implementation of Huffman coding forms a complete text compression system based on character frequencies where the higher frequencies have shorter binary codes that may assist in effective data compression. It contains a very robust Huffman Node class used in the creation of the tree, and an important Huffman Coding class that manages such processes as encoding and decoding, among other utilities, including tree visualization and compression statistics.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

**Prerequisites:** The proposed usage of Huffman coding expect the presence of Python 3.7+, introduced on any working framework, whether it be Windows, macOS, or Linux.

**Libraries:** It depends generally on heapq-a built-in module that gives an execution of the load line calculation, moreover known as the need line calculation, and standard Python libraries.

**Dependencies:** This code is platform-independent and has negligible conditions, utilizing as it were the standard library of Python itself, making it lovely simple to run without introducing extra bundles.

**System Requirements:** It would be great to have 4GB Slam for superior execution; in any case, this can be not essential. Command-line interface execution is required, so a terminal or command incite is vital.

**Version:** Improvement has been tried on Python 3.7-3.11 forms but ought to moreover work for more later ones. 

### Installing

**How/where to download your program**
  
**Clone from repository:** git clone [repository-url]

**Download directly:** Save the Python file (.py) to our personal laptop.

**Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders**

There are no special changes that need to be done for this Huffman coding program in the files or folders. The Python file just needs to be placed with a .py extension in any directory. When running, the program will not create any new files. Also, it does not require special permissions or special folder structures to run perfectly.

### Executing program

**Colab link:** https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nKBWzt_gwwt39HvxKFk3cUsN7xBiGWYi?usp=sharing

**How to run the program**

**1.Open Google Colab**
+Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
+Click "New Notebook" or "File" → "New notebook"


**2.Prepare Notebook**
+First cell: Optional import verification
```
import heapq
```

**3.Write Huffman Tree Code**
+Write the code along with logic
+Write the entire code into a new code cell

**4.Final Code Cell for Execution**
+Add this at end of script to automatically run
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**5.Run the Notebook**
+Use Runtime → Run all
+Alternatively, use Shift+Enter to run selected cell

**6.Interaction**
+Follow on-screen prompts
+Enter character frequencies

**7.Save Notebook**
+Go to File and then click Save
+Now,Choose Google Drive or any other to download in .ipynb or .py file
